Plex Media Server ubuntu package
---------------------------------

* What is this?
These are scripts that repackage binaries released by plexapp.com to a
Ubuntu package.

* What's good about them?
- Automatically depends on avahi packages and ia32 libs.
- Installs upstart scripts
- Automatically creates a plex user that will run the server
- It's much cleaner!

* Who did this?
These are NOT OFFICIAL packages, rather made by Tobias Hieta, because
I like to have things clean on my Ubuntu server.

* How to use?
- Get the Ubuntu Linux build of Plex Media Server from http://plexapp.com/labs.
- Untar it alongside the debian directory.
- Then rename PlexMediaServer-<version> to 'src'.
- Run 'fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b'
This will get you a plexmediaserver-xx.deb in the parent directory
- Install it with 'dpkg -i *deb'

That's it!

* Why can't I just get a .deb or a apt source?
I would love to, but
1) I don't have the official OK to redistribute the binaries, so I don't
   want that until that is sorted.
2) I am not sure how many downloads a .deb would get and since the files
   are pretty big, I am not sure that I have the available bandwidth for
   that.

Hopefully the Plex team will agree and we can work something out :-)

* Have you tested this?
Yes, but only on ubuntu 10.04 LTS amd64. So I am not sure that it will
work on other systems.

* Where can I file bugs and see the scripts?
On github. https://github.com/tru/PlexMediaServer-Ubuntu

* Details please!
OK! The debian package creates a new user called 'plex' that runs the
Plex Media Server. The Library folder can be found in /var/lib/plexmediaserver

The package also installs a upstart configuration file that will start PMS
upon boot. It will also respawn if something goes wrong.
